## Overview
>Online shopping refers to a delivery and pick-up service. This particular service  is offered by companies through a website and mobile app. The service allows customers to order items from participating retailers with the shopping being done by a personal shopper or company.
>Covid-19 has changed the way the world operates. The ‘new normal’ has also seen dramatic increases in online shopping trends for apparent reasons. Contactless transactions are safer, and lockdowns have given people no choice but to use online platforms to purchase goods. As you know, however, don’t last forever. Still, once a customer has experienced the convenience and safety of an initially obligated online shopping experience, they are very likely to use it again even when they don’t have to.
>Some of the advantages of online shopping include; there are a variety of products, it's covenient, there are a lot of online discounts, there is buyer/shopping secrecy, the customers can avoid crowds, you can find unique/rare products and there is detailed information about the products that you are buying.
>To effect some of these advantages of online shopping a recommendation system or recommendation engine can be used for information filtering where it tries to predict the preferences of a user and provide suggestions based on these preferences.

## Project Goal
To provide a recommendation system that will help both existing and new customers. Our main of creating a recommendation system is to categorise the customers based on their purchase quantities and set this as our guide in recommending the products based on the size of a business.This will help create a better shopping environment for the retailers and cut cost on their intiial research and development costs.
